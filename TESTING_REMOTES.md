# What now?  Program the remotes

* All remotes ship transmitting the same codes as one another 
* Use the corresponding APF03 transmitter to teach each remote unique codes
  * `433mhz_remote_program_sketch` transmits the code we want to use for the specific ref and button
  * clear each remote 
    * hold A+B until fast flash, then press B 3 times with A still held
  * upload program sketch to Arduino
  * hold remote ~2cm away from transmitter (unless using an external antenna) and hold down the button to program, should flash quickly then stop for a few seconds, then flash again slowly
  * comment out the button code sending line in the sketch source, and uncomment the next button, then recompile and upload

## Button map

* Red - A
* White - B
* Clear (head only) - C
